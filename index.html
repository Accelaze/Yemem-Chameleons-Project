    <div class="intro"><p>Chameleons are fascinating creatures, mainly for how their colour changes with how they are feeling on contrary to what people seem to think that they change to the colour of their surroundings. 
        <br><br> There are many different kinds of chameleonss, ranging from the Yemen/Veiled Chameleon (the one above) which are one of the best options when taking chameleons as pets for the first time, to the biggest ones: Parson's chameleons. 
        <br><br> The Yemen/Veiled chameleons are native to Saudi Arabia. 
        <br><br> Adult males Yemen/Veiled chameleons can grow up to 17 to 24 inches, including their tail, while the females are a little smaller, growing up to 10 to 14 inches.</p></div>
