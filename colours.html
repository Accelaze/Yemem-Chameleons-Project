            <p>Chameleons turn this colour when they are comfortable with their environment but are 
                also alert incase of any imminent or sudden danger.
                <br><br>They have excellent grip on the branches 
                they are perched on and will easily hide withing the plants and foliage.
                <br><br>They're eyes are constantly scanning the place for any danger, 
                healthy chameleons NEVER have their eyes closed during the day.
                <br><br>Its tail serves two purposes; they can tightly grip onto branches and serve 
                as aid for balance when walking/climbing on branches.
                <br><br>Different chameleons have different patterns when showing stress/anger. 
                They can show dramatic spots or go black/dark.</p>

            <p>When a chameleon is scared or feeling threatened there are several things 
                it will do purely out of survival intinct.
            <br><br>It will flatten its body to look bigger to any predator (or you if it does not 
            feel safe with you) and puff out its Gular (throat) to look bigger.
            <br><br>It will gape its jaws (open the mouth and clearly show teeth) to show it means business.
            <br><br>It'll put one of its front legs up in a protective position. If threat increases it'll 
            put both front legs up.
            <br><br>It'll turn into bright colours ( orblack spots if stressed or grabbed) to warn the intruder away.
            <br><br>If you continue if whatever you are doing or go closer to the chameleon it'll hiss at you.
            <br><br>If you these signs are ignored the chameleon will either bite you or show the traits of a sick chameleon.</p>
